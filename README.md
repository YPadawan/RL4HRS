# hydrogen_optimization

Project reuniting R&D efforts to develop products using ML and optimization for the exploitation of hydrogen stations. Made in the context of a start-up endeavor.

The repository is supposed to contains:

- Python files contianing:
    - The gym custom environment `HydrogenStationEnv` containing the agent's behaviour
    - The **hydrogen_station.py** contains all the classes for the hydrogen station + the wind turbine for the renewable energy source
    - A **utils.py** containing basic utility functions like the `grid_tariffs`
The notebooks directory contains:
    - The main notebooks for reading data and simulation and the training of the agent
    - Some notebooks made for practice with the necessary packages (gym, pytorch...)
